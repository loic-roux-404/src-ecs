# This file sets the configuration options related to the backend design.
# If your backend is simple, you probably can rely on the default values of
# the options and just define the value of the 'site_name' option.
#
# NOTE: this demo application splits the backend configuration into several
# small files for educational purposes. In your application you can put the
# entire backend configuration in just one file.
#
# The configuration options are explained in detail in the bundle documentation,
# which is published at https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle
